This is a blog about Python communities. It aims at providing knowledge about the existing communities, tips and hints on creating new ones, bringing them to life, and have them grow and prosper.


Why
===

My belief is that it's the group of people that fosters the adoption of a language or project. Knowing about the existing communities can provide invaluable information to create new ones, improve and grow others, and ultimately, sharing the knowledge benefits everyone.


How
===

Gathering information about existing communities helps new adopters of a language or project find the group of people they would like to bind to, and leaders of communities to get inspired by other's successes and fails.


What
====

Stories and interviews, reports from past events and conferences, hints and tips, advices from community founders and members, anything that could inspire and help.
